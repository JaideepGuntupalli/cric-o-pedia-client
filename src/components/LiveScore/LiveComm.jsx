                        "We did well to restrict them to 170 runs. What really
                        let us down was the batsmanship. I feel especially when
                        we are chasing, you know what's required on the board
                        and what the bowlers are doing. At times you have to
                        curb your instinct and try to see what the situation is
                        demanding rather than just play your shot. If the
                        batsmanship had been slightly better, maybe in the last
                        few overs we wouldn't have needed many runs. We got off
                        to a good start, we had wickets in hand and the wicket
                        kept getting better. It's just that we kept losing
                        wickets at regular intervals. If you take care of those
                        things, chasing is more about calculation and batting
                        first is more about instinct. As a batter in the middle,
                        you have to decide on those things. We need to keep
                        looking at what went wrong. It's easy to get distracted
                        by how many points you have. It's the process that
                        matters more than where you are positioned in the points
                        table. If you take care of those things, then the points
                        table will take care of itself."

                    <p className="text-sm">
                        "It was a really good bowling effort. We felt there was
                        enough tackiness in the wicket to exploit with our
                        spinners and then for our quicks to hold their nerve at
                        the back end with some really powerful death hitters,
                        they did a great job to finish that game. With the way
                        that Moeen Ali and Jadeja bowled in the first innings,
                        it showed that the finger spinners were getting a bit of
                        hold and getting a little bit of grip out of the
                        surface. For me it was just about trying to pitch the
                        ball on the stumps as much as I can and try to vary the
                        seam angle to try and get that variable spin out of the
                        wicket. It was helpful to have a couple of lefties out
                        there where I was able to turn the ball away from the
                        bat and just give us another option at the back end as
                        well. [Bowling around the wicket to the right-handers] I
                        think it just shuts down one side of the ground. With
                        the Robin [Uthappa wicket], if I do that from over the
                        stumps, it becomes more of a pull shot for him which is
                        more of his strength. To be able to cramp him up and not
                        give him a free swing was key at that stage. We've gone
                        through troughs in this tournament so hopefully we can
                        ride this momentum. Winning momentum is hard to stop and
                        we feel like our batters are starting to hit the middle
                        of the bat more and more. With our bowlers starting to
                        gel, we feel like we're starting to go in the right
                        direction. Hopefully we haven't left it too late and we
                        can peak right towards finals and find away into that
                        top four and do some damage in the finals."

                        "We definitely needed that, just for the confidence in
                        the group. The guys have been doing some good things
                        behind the scenes but you have to do it out in the
                        middle. To put up a decent total today on a wicket with
                        a bit of challenge towards it, I think we're definitely
                        moving in the right direction with the batting lineup
                        and confidence the guys are getting. With the bowling
                        department, we've been very good throughout the
                        tournament so it was just a case of backing it up with
                        some good runs. I thought 165 was a par score so
                        anything above that would be nice to get. The Powerplay
                        was probably going to be the easiest time to score
                        because the wicket had a little bit of stop to it. They
                        had a good start in the Powerplay, but once we got two
                        wickets, I thought we were excellent. Energy in the
                        field was amazing, guys diving all over the place, great
                        catching and some good bowling as well. We're very lucky
                        to have experience and guys who captain their own teams.
                        It's great for me, when there's some questions to be
                        asked that I can lean on a really good senior player
                        group. The communication is getting better on the field
                        now that we know each other a bit better. We just want
                        to keep improving in the batting department. We want one
                        of the top four to bat through and get that 70+ score
                        because we've got enough power around that can come in.
                        So it's just that consistency around the batting unit
                        and keep making sure we play a positive brand of cricket
                        and not be too defensive. [Asked about net run rate]
                        Once you get an opportunity in a match when you can
                        think about it, then you think about it. But it's about
                        making sure we get the wins. If we get the wins, we'll
                        be there or thereabouts. I never think about it too far
                        ahead."

                        "I think in the first over, I was trying to bowl slower
                        balls into the pitch but I floated a couple just under
                        the bat and those are the ones that went to the
                        boundary. For the last four or five games, I've been
                        trying to concede two less boundaries in my spell but be
                        a little more tighter with my execution and sequencing.
                        When I look at my last four or five games, I didn't have
                        as much impact as I did in the first half. So that's
                        what I've been trying to correct and very happy I was
                        able to come back the way I did. [On changing ends] To
                        both the left-handers, we decided I would bowl wider of
                        off stump and that allowed me to use the bigger side. So
                        that was the rationale to changing ends. You need to be
                        aware of what the conditions are and what the batters
                        are trying to do and what areas they are trying to score
                        in, and most importantly what are the deliveries you can
                        execute and you feel confident about in that situation.
                        So you take all these calculations in your mind and at
                        the top of your mark, you need to be absolutely clear
                        with your option and your field placing. As long as you
                        have clarity at the top of your mark, you should be
                        fine. [Asked about slower balls on different pitches]
                        Sequencing, like I said, when people are waiting for the
                        slower balls, how do I make sure I don't give them
                        slower balls. So that's when my hard lengths, bouncers
                        and yorkers come in. I have not been able to use a lot
                        this season, especially the yorkers, but it's something
                        I want to bring back in the second half of the IPL."
